                                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI)
                                focused on the development of algorithms and models that enable
                                computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on
                                data without being explicitly programmed. It involves training
                                models on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships,
                                which can then be used to make predictions or perform tasks such
                                as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement
